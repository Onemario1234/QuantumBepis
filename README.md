# Quantum Bepis
 This is a mod in the WORKS, BABY
 Keeping last two notes for later, don't worry about them.
 
 Bepis is a cool mod that
 - Is Quantum
 - Exists
 - Changes appearances far more drastically than the Quantum Moon with each planet it orbits!
 - Bepis
 - Special Signals edited by Trifid, the lad.
 
 This is a temporary README, it'll become more professional once the full release is incoming.

8. Releasing the mod. See the "Releasing the mod" section on the  [Outer Wilds Mod Template](https://github.com/Raicuparta/ow-mod-template) repo for info on how to do this. Be sure to try out the mod by adding it to your OWML mods folder and make sure it works in game before releasing. When you zip your final mod be sure to exclude the README.md file and the config.json file (they aren't needed in the release). The zip file should contain: `planets`, `default-config.json`, `manifest.json`, and `NewHorizonsConfig.dll`. When using the template when you update the manifest version from 0.0.0 to 0.1.0 or whatever you want, it will automatically make a new release.
9. Updating your mod. You can make any changes to your mod on your computer. Then from Github desktop you can commit and then push those changes to your repo online. When you are ready to release the new version of your mod, just changed the version number in `manifest.json`. Once the `manifest.json` version number is increased and pushed, a new release will automatically be created.
