# Quantum Bepis
 As my first mod ever, Bepis is a Quantum Planet that orbits every astral body in the Star System, including the comet.
 
 Bepis, in the final release, will feature...
 - A different appearance for every planet it orbits; vastly different than the Quantum Moon's surface.
 - The word Bepis.
 - Ship Log Entries for every Variant, along with some light story planned in the future!
 - Special Signals emitted by the variants that were edited by TerrificTrifid, the lad.
 - Something else...?
 
 This is a temporary README, it'll become more finalized once the full release is incoming.
 
 The notes below this are kept here so I can refer to them later. Don't mind them.

8. Releasing the mod. See the "Releasing the mod" section on the  [Outer Wilds Mod Template](https://github.com/Raicuparta/ow-mod-template) repo for info on how to do this. Be sure to try out the mod by adding it to your OWML mods folder and make sure it works in game before releasing. When you zip your final mod be sure to exclude the README.md file and the config.json file (they aren't needed in the release). The zip file should contain: `planets`, `default-config.json`, `manifest.json`, and `NewHorizonsConfig.dll`. When using the template when you update the manifest version from 0.0.0 to 0.1.0 or whatever you want, it will automatically make a new release.
9. Updating your mod. You can make any changes to your mod on your computer. Then from Github desktop you can commit and then push those changes to your repo online. When you are ready to release the new version of your mod, just changed the version number in `manifest.json`. Once the `manifest.json` version number is increased and pushed, a new release will automatically be created.
